# Singly Linked Lists
Think of a singly linked list like a chain of connected beads. Each bead is a "node" and holds some information. It also has a string attached to the next bead in the chain.

- You start with the first bead, called the "head."
- Each bead has two parts: the information it carries and a string pointing to the next bead.
- You can add new beads to the chain or remove them.
- If you want to find a specific bead, you have to start at the head and follow the strings until you reach the right one.

In simple terms, a singly linked list is like a chain of connected items where you can only move in one direction, from the first item to the next and so on.

## Data Definition: 
This is like giving a clear and simple description of something. It should be easy to understand and describe a single idea or thing.

## Data Object: 
Think of this as an object that holds information or data.

## Data Type: 
Imagine data as different kinds of things, like numbers or words. Data types are like categories that help us understand what we can do with each kind of data. For example, numbers can be used for math, and words can be used for text.

### Built-in Data Type: 
These are like the basic categories, such as numbers, true/false values, and decimal numbers, which the computer already knows how to work with.

### Derived Data Type: 
These are made by combining the basic categories or operations, like creating a list from individual items, similar to making a shopping list.

### Basic Operations: 
These are like actions we can perform on our data. The kind of data structure we use depends on what we want to do with it. Here are some common operations:

### Traversing: 
Going through the data one by one, like reading a book page by page.

### Searching: 
Looking for specific information in the data, like finding a word in a dictionary.

### Insertion: 
Adding new data to our existing data, like putting a new book on a shelf.

### Deletion: 
Removing data from our collection, like taking a book off the shelf.

## Sorting: 
Putting the data in order, like arranging books alphabetically.

## Merging: 
Combining two sets of data, like mixing two sets of playing cards.
